# Interactive Autobiographical Timeline – Design Choices

- **Dark, Modern Aesthetic:**  
  A dark theme with neon accents and smooth gradients creates a sleek, modern feel. All text and interactive elements are styled to be clearly visible against the dark background.

- **Chronological, Auto-Scrolling Timeline:**  
  The timeline is arranged horizontally from birth (left) to the newest event (right). An auto-scroll feature continuously advances the timeline without showing scrollbars, ensuring a seamless experience.

- **Interactive Background:**  
  An embedded, mini interactive Pong game plays in the background. This playful element adds a dynamic layer without distracting from the timeline content.

- **Sticky Key & Responsive Layout:**  
  The icon key is fixed at the top right corner for easy reference. Timeline events are presented in modern “card” style with hover effects, and each event opens a modal with additional details.

- **User Interaction:**  
  - **Hover Effects:** Cards and thumbnails brighten and lift on hover.  
  - **Click to Open Modal:** Detailed information (including title, date, caption, and description) is available via modals.  
  - **Click Outside to Close:** Clicking outside a modal dismisses it.

- **Technologies:**  
  HTML5, CSS3 (with transitions and dark-theme gradients), JavaScript for interactivity and auto-scrolling, and an HTML5 Canvas for the Pong game.
